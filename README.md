## FAQ

I believe this will answer most of the questions I'll ever get asked about this.

### Isn't Supnetwork full of trolls?
Nah we're good. Mostly.

### Why on earth did you use Node
I wanted to check out ES6, and I don't think that the single threaded nature of it will be a problem for this.

### Why didn't you make this in Go

### Why didn't you make this in Kotlin/Java
I wasn't fond of Java as a server dependency.
And I don't like Gradle and maven! Kotlin is definitely on my list of stuff to try, but for Android.

### Why didn't you make this in PHP
☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)

### Why didn't you make this in Swift/ObjC
I wish I could have, but Swift isn't really mature on Linux yet.
Also, there's no IRC/Discord lib for it, and writing that from scratch is out of scope for this project.

### Why didn't you make this in C#
Just leave me alone already.
